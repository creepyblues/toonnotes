## Insights & Learnings

> **Decision:** Used Supabase for auth to support all platforms (iOS, Android, web) with single backend.

> **Learning:** Apple Sign-In requires JWT client secret generation with specific Service ID and Key ID configuration.

> **Decision:** Starting with GA4/GTM for analytics before committing to paid monitoring services.
