## Insights & Learnings

> **Decision:** Built marketing dashboard into main website with admin-only access via email/password auth.

> **Decision:** Product version tracking as policy - all marketing assets tagged with product-version.

> **Learning:** Magic link auth had issues with localhost redirects - switched to email/password for reliability.
