# Development Diary - January 6, 2026

## Daily Summary

Focused on App Store and Play Store launch preparation. Created ASO-optimized app descriptions, updated privacy policy for data encryption accuracy, and consolidated sticker API endpoints to work within Vercel's function limits. Also researched cross-platform architecture for web app separation and updated monetization strategy documentation.

---

## Work Sessions

### Session 1: Cross-Platform Architecture Research (2:36 AM - 3:19 AM PST)

**Focus:** Multi-Platform Architecture Planning

Activities:
- Researched cross-platform architecture models
- Analyzed how world-class apps handle web app separation (app.domain.com)
- Planned separation of website (toonnotes.com) from web app (app.toonnotes.com)
- Designed cloud sync as premium service across devices
- Saved architecture plan to ToonNotes_Expo docs

**Key Decision:** Keep marketing website separate from web app with dedicated subdomain.

---

### Session 2: Monetization Strategy Review (2:38 AM - 3:19 AM PST)

**Focus:** Simplifying Monetization Model

Activities:
- Reviewed monetization implementation status
- Compared documentation with actual implementation
- **Removed** Usage limits (auto-label 20/mo, export 5/mo, watermarks)
- **Removed** Mega Pack (100 coins / $9.99)
- Committed monetization strategy updates

**Decision:** Simplified the monetization model by removing complexity.

---

### Session 3: ASO & Store Listing (3:50 PM - 7:10 PM PST)

**Focus:** App Store Optimization

Activities:
- Created ASO-optimized short description for App Store/Play Store
- Created full description for store listings
- Discovered documentation didn't match current features:
  - No longer have 12 comic-style border templates
  - Now have auto-labeling feature
- Updated feature documentation to match implementation
- Used marketing engine for description generation

**Data Security Review:**
- Verified all user data is encrypted in transit
- Updated privacy policy for accuracy

---

### Session 4: Account Deletion Feature (6:30 PM - 7:10 PM PST)

**Focus:** Play Store Compliance

Activities:
- Added account deletion feature (required by Play Store)
- Created URL link for users to request data deletion
- Implemented deletion request flow

---

### Session 5: Vercel Deployment Configuration (6:38 PM - 7:02 PM PST)

**Focus:** CI/CD Setup

Activities:
- Investigated Vercel deployment configuration
- Checked if git push triggers auto-deployment
- Configured toonnotes-web for git-triggered deploys
- Debugged toonnotes-api not picking up deployments
- Discovered Vercel function limit issue

---

### Session 6: API Consolidation (Late Evening)

**Focus:** Vercel Function Limit Fix

Activities:
- Consolidated 4 sticker API endpoints into 1
- Merged endpoints:
  - `generate-sticker.ts`
  - `generate-image-sticker.ts`
  - `generate-themed-sticker.ts`
  - (into single endpoint)
- Updated `geminiService.ts` for consolidated API
- Fixed `remove-background.ts`
- Reduced codebase by 416 lines (-540/+124)

**Reason:** Vercel has a limit on number of serverless functions; consolidation was necessary for deployment.

## Insights & Learnings

> **Learning:** Vercel has limits on the number of serverless functions per project. Consolidating similar endpoints into one with action parameters is the solution.

> **Decision:** Simplified monetization by removing usage limits and Mega Pack - focusing on simpler coin packs and Pro subscription only.

> **Decision:** Keeping marketing site (toonnotes.com) separate from web app (app.toonnotes.com) follows best practices from world-class apps like Notion, Figma, and Linear.

> **Learning:** Play Store requires an accessible URL for account/data deletion requests. This is a compliance requirement, not optional.
