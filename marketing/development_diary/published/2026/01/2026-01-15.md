# Development Diary - January 15, 2026

## Daily Summary

Focused on improving developer experience and preparing for App Store launch. Created three new Claude Code skills: `/ios-design` for Apple HIG-compliant UI design, `/dev-start` for one-command development environment setup, and `/build-dist` for iOS/Android distribution builds. Also ran comprehensive code review with unit tests and fixed several bugs including dynamic version display.

## Work Sessions

### Session 1: Early Morning Bug Fixes (2:42 AM - 6:38 AM)

**Focus:** Regression Fixes and Documentation

Activities:
- Updated documentation for recent changes
- Debugged iOS simulator loading errors
- Investigated regression in Designs page "create new design" flow
- Fixed backend API 500 error for sticker generation

**Key Issue:** Designs page create flow was broken - both functionality and design regressed.

---

### Session 2: iOS Design Skill Creation (6:10 AM - 3:55 PM)

**Focus:** Creating `/ios-design` Skill

Activities:
- Created new skill for designing iOS app following Apple's Human Interface Guidelines
- Referenced Settings page redesign as the gold standard
- Applied skill to Note Edit page redesign
- Resized UI elements for visual balance (+ button matching "+ Add Label")

**Outcome:** New `/ios-design` skill enables consistent Apple-style UI design across the app.

---

### Session 3: Comprehensive Code Review (6:15 AM - 5:18 PM)

**Focus:** Quality Assurance

Activities:
- Ran comprehensive code review for both iOS and Android apps
- Created unit tests covering all features, functions, and links
- Fixed identified issues from the review
- Committed and pushed all fixes
- Restarted all servers fresh and tested on iOS simulator

---

### Session 4: Note Editor Polish (6:42 AM - 3:56 PM)

**Focus:** UI Text Updates

Activities:
- Removed placeholder "start typing... use # to add labels" from note edit page
- Added new placeholder "Your thoughts" for cleaner UX

---

### Session 5: Dev Environment Automation (3:55 PM - 6:58 PM)

**Focus:** Creating `/dev-start` Skill

Activities:
- Identified pain point: "API error" on every simulator start
- Created `/dev-start` skill for one-command development setup
- Skill kills pre-existing servers/simulators for fresh reload
- Ensures fully functioning, ready-to-test environment

**Key Prompts:**
- "Create a skill or command to get fully functioning and ready-to-test server & simulator running with one command"

---

### Session 6: Build Distribution Skill (5:11 PM - 7:03 PM)

**Focus:** Creating `/build-dist` Skill

Activities:
- Created skill for iOS and Android distribution builds
- Supports TestFlight and Play Store builds
- Integrated with EAS Build system
- Tested `/build-dist check` and `/build-dist android` commands

---

### Session 7: Version Display Fix (7:04 PM - 7:26 PM)

**Focus:** Settings Page Bug Fix

Activities:
- Debugged version number not updating on simulator
- Fixed hardcoded version to read dynamically from app.json
- Added build date display capability
- Committed and pushed the fix

---

### Session 8: App Store Launch Planning (7:10 PM)

**Focus:** Monetization Preparation

Activities:
- Inspected PRD and current Coin/Subscription implementation
- Created detailed execution plan for App Store launch readiness

---

## Categorized Work

### Implementation
- Created `/ios-design` skill for Apple HIG-compliant design
- Created `/dev-start` skill for development environment automation
- Created `/build-dist` skill for iOS/Android distribution builds
- Added explicit `react-native-css-interop` dependency for EAS builds

### Bug Fix
- Fixed Designs page "create new design" regression
- Fixed backend API 500 error for sticker generation
- Fixed Settings page to display dynamic version from app.json

### Testing
- Comprehensive code review for iOS and Android apps
- Created unit tests covering all features and functions
- End-to-end link verification

### Documentation
- Updated documentation for recent changes
- Documented new skills and their usage

### DevOps
- Prepared build distribution workflow
- Fixed EAS build dependency issues

## Insights & Learnings

> **Decision:** Created `/dev-start` skill to eliminate the repeated "API error" friction when starting development. One command now handles killing stale processes and starting fresh.

> **Learning:** Hardcoding version numbers in UI leads to confusion during testing. Always read from the source of truth (app.json).

> **Decision:** Invested in skill creation for recurring tasks (ios-design, dev-start, build-dist) to improve long-term developer velocity.
