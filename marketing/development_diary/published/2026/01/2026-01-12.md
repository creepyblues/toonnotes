# Development Diary - January 12, 2026

## Daily Summary

Focused session on fixing Vercel deployment configuration for the API routes in the Expo app. The monorepo structure required careful placement of `vercel.json` to enable API-only deployment. After some debugging, successfully got the API routes working on Vercel.

## Work Sessions

### Session 1: Vercel API Deployment Fix (6:19 PM - 8:55 PM PST)

**Focus:** API Deployment Configuration

Activities:
- Debugged Vercel deployment issues for API routes
- Initially placed `vercel.json` at monorepo root
- Discovered it needed to be in `apps/expo/` for correct routing
- Added `public/.gitkeep` for static file placeholder
- Configured rewrites for API routes
- Successfully tested deployment

**Key Moments:**
- First attempt: Added `vercel.json` at root level
- Discovery: "it was toonnotes-api" - identified the project context
- Resolution: Moved config to `apps/expo/vercel.json`
- Success: "it worked! commit the changes"

## Categorized Work

### Bug Fix
- Moved `vercel.json` from monorepo root to `apps/expo/` for correct API routing
- Fixed deployment configuration that wasn't recognizing API routes

### DevOps
- Created initial `vercel.json` for API-only deployment
- Added `public/.gitkeep` placeholder for Vercel static file requirement
- Configured URL rewrites for serverless API functions

## Insights & Learnings

> **Learning:** In a monorepo with Vercel, the `vercel.json` must be placed in the specific app directory (`apps/expo/`) rather than the monorepo root for API routes to be properly recognized and deployed.

> **Learning:** Vercel requires a `public/` directory (even if empty with just `.gitkeep`) for deployments that include both static files and API routes.
