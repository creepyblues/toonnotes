# Development Diary - January 8, 2026

## Daily Summary

Productive day focused on enabling beta testing for cloud sync and building marketing infrastructure. Created a beta testers admin page to manage Pro status overrides, tested cloud sync functionality across devices, and designed and shipped an early access promo page for waitlist collection and hypothesis validation.

## Work Sessions

### Session 1: Competitor Research (12:03 AM - 12:25 AM PST)

**Focus:** Onboarding Competitor Analysis

Activities:
- Researched Tier 1 competitors (Keep, Apple Notes)
- Researched Tier 2 competitors for onboarding profiling
- Prepared competitor list for onboarding flow

---

### Session 2: Cloud Sync Testing & Admin Tools (7:38 AM - 6:51 PM PST)

**Focus:** Beta Testing Infrastructure

Activities:
- Started iOS simulator for testing
- Cleaned local database to test cloud sync
- Debugged cloud sync not working after sign-in (sungho101@gmail.com)
- Explored setting Pro tier for testing without code changes
- Configured RevenueCat API keys (iOS and Android)
- Created beta tester override in authStore
- Built beta testers admin page at `/marketing/beta-testers`
- Added user toggle switch to update `is_beta_tester` in database
- Debugged admin page update errors (SQL permissions)
- Successfully tested beta tester toggle functionality

**Key Prompts:**
- "Can I set the tier as Pro during testing without changing the codebase like using edge function?"
- "Let's make a simple web page where I can view and update the user data"

---

### Session 3: RevenueCat Configuration (7:39 AM - 6:11 PM PST)

**Focus:** Subscription Setup

Activities:
- Committed and pushed latest codebase
- Explored manual Pro tier changes in Supabase
- Configured RevenueCat API keys for iOS and Android
- Decided on implementation approach for beta testing

---

### Session 4: Build & Version Labeling (6:12 PM - 8:19 PM PST)

**Focus:** Release Preparation

Activities:
- Rebuilt iOS simulator with latest code changes
- Verified cloud sync working for beta testers
- Pushed all changes to git
- Labeled version 1.2.1 with cloud sync tested
- Triggered EAS build for iOS and Android

---

### Session 5: Label Suggestions Fix (6:51 PM - 8:41 PM PST)

**Focus:** Bug Fix

Activities:

- Discovered label design not applying to notes (regression)
- Tested on Android device via USB
- Debugged code sync issues

---

### Session 7: TestFlight Preparation (10:34 PM - 10:55 PM PST)

**Focus:** App Store Submission

Activities:
- Started iOS simulator with latest code
- Researched TestFlight submission process
- Continued debugging label design regression

---

### Session 8: Early Access Promo Page (11:52 PM PST)

**Focus:** Marketing & Validation

Activities:
- Researched effective hypothesis validation approaches
- Designed promo page for waitlist collection
- Considered invitation-only launch strategy
- Built early access page with:
  - Hero section
  - Pain cards (target user problems)
  - How it works section
  - Design showcase
  - Promise/value proposition
  - Signup form
- Added session tracking and waitlist API endpoints

**Key Research:** Explored ways to validate ToonNotes hypothesis and gather information about target users' problems and unmet needs.

## Insights & Learnings

> **Decision:** Implemented beta tester flag (`is_beta_tester`) in database to grant Pro features without requiring RevenueCat subscription, enabling flexible testing.

> **Learning:** RevenueCat requires separate API keys for iOS (`appl_`) and Android (`goog_`) platforms.

> **Decision:** Built admin page at `/marketing/beta-testers` for easy management of beta testers rather than direct database manipulation.

> **Learning:** For early access/waitlist pages, combining pain point validation with signup creates dual value - user acquisition and hypothesis testing simultaneously.
