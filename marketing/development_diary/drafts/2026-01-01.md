## Work Sessions

### Session 1: Checkbox/Bullet Editor Fix (1:27 AM - 6:04 AM PST)

**Focus:** Text Editor Complexity

Activities:

## Insights & Learnings

> **Learning:** Text formatting in React Native is complex because TextInput state management conflicts with native cursor positioning. Studying mature implementations (Google Keep) provides proven patterns.

> **Decision:** Made icon generation for new labels deterministic and keyword-aware, ensuring consistent visual identity for each label.

> **Decision:** Designed onboarding system to be robust and updatable, anticipating rapid feature additions in upcoming versions.

> **Learning:** TestFlight setup requires privacy policy URL before submission. Plan for legal/policy documentation early.
