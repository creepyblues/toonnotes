# Development Diary - December 21, 2025

## Daily Summary

The official start of ToonNotes Expo development. Launched the complete React Native/Expo app with Story Style and Webtoon Artist AI features, design templates, note management, and boards functionality. Later added production readiness improvements including comprehensive unit tests and validation utilities.

## Work Sessions

### Session 1: Early Morning Testing (5:24 AM - 9:28 AM)

**Focus:** Webtoon Artist Feature Testing

Activities:
- Tested the webtoon artist feature functionality
- Initial app validation and debugging

**Key Prompts:**
- "test the webtoon artist feature"

---

### Session 2: Android Planning (9:30 AM)

**Focus:** Cross-Platform Research

Activities:
- Researched best practices for Android development with current Expo stack
- Planned potential Android expansion

**Key Prompts:**
- "let's say I want to create an Android app based on this current expo app built for iPhone. research the best practice with our current dev stack and come up with a plan."

---

### Session 3: Design UI Improvements (9:48 AM - 5:37 PM)

**Focus:** Design Template UX

Activities:
- Improved design templates to match note design appearance
- Added template names to My Designs and Apply Design pages
- Streamlined Add Reference flow by removing redundant buttons
- Adjusted note navigation and close behavior
- Removed decorative elements from design cards

**Key Prompts:**
- "for design templates, make them look the same as note design"
- "on the 'Add Reference', remove 'Select Image' button which is redundant"
- "run the app to test design cards"

---

### Session 4: Background & Frame Fixes (5:38 PM - 11:28 PM)

**Focus:** Background Image and Frame Rendering

Activities:
- Fixed background image fill issues in notes
- Debugged frame border rendering for note designs
- Updated watercolor template
- Improved design creation flow navigation
- Initiated comprehensive code review for production readiness
- Added unit tests for stores, services, and utilities

**Key Prompts:**
- "when background was added to a note, the background image doesn't fill the full note area"
- "for some reason, some note design doesn't come with frame. inspect why this is happening"
- "when i create a new design from a note, instead of sending me to My Design page, send me back to the note"
- "let's run a code review for the entire app to make sure this is ready for production including unit test"

## Insights & Learnings

> **Decision:** Built the app using React Native/Expo for cross-platform capability while initially targeting iOS.

> **Learning:** Background image fill requires careful handling of frame borders to ensure proper coverage.

> **Decision:** Chose MobX-style stores for state management with debounced persistence.
