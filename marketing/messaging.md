## Brand Positioning (Strategy v2)

**One-liner:**
> Capture everything. Organize nothing. See it beautifully.

**Elevator Pitch:**
> ToonNotes is for heavy note-takers who have given up on organization. Unlike Notion (which requires you to build a system) or Apple Notes (which buries everything in an ugly list), ToonNotes uses AI to automatically organize AND beautifully design your notes—so you get the benefits of a second brain without the work, and outputs you're proud to share.

**For Users:**
> ToonNotes is the note app for people who take lots of notes but hate organizing them. AI handles the structure AND the design—so your notes actually become useful, and look amazing doing it.

## Ideal Customer Profile

### The Prolific Procrastinator

> *"I take a lot of notes but lack the organization skill or time to organize them. I've tried the fancy tools—they're too much work. I just need my notes to make sense AND look good without me doing anything."*

**Behavioral Signals:**
- Takes 20-100+ notes per month (High volume user)
- Has abandoned Notion/Obsidian workspace (Tried power tools, gave up)
- Cares about aesthetics (Pinterest, design-forward apps)
- Says "I know I wrote this somewhere..." (Retrieval pain)
- Envies organized people's systems but won't build one (Wants outcome, not process)

**See:** `audiences/prolific-procrastinator.yaml` for full definition.

## The Two AI Pillars

### Pillar 1: AI Organization
*Structure without effort*

AI reads, categorizes, and connects your notes automatically. No manual tagging, no folder decisions, no maintenance.

| Feature | User Benefit |
|---------|--------------|
| Auto-Labeling | Never manually tag again |
| Smart Grouping | See relationships automatically |
| Summaries | Instant understanding |
| Suggestions | Know what to do next |

### Pillar 2: AI Design
*Visualization as organization*

How notes look IS how they're organized. AI creates visual layouts that make sense of your thoughts—personalized to your aesthetic.

| Feature | User Benefit |
|---------|--------------|
| Visual Layouts | Organization you can see |
| Smart Theming | Consistent aesthetic |
| Personal Style | Notes feel like "mine" |
| Shareable Beauty | Share-ready results |

**Key Insight:** Design IS Organization. When notes *look* organized, users *feel* organized—even without folders or tags.

## Feature Descriptions (v2)

### AI Organization
**Short:** AI reads, labels, and connects your notes automatically.
**Medium:** ToonNotes uses AI to analyze every note you capture—automatically labeling topics, grouping related ideas, and surfacing connections you'd never notice. No folders. No tags. Just answers.
**Long:** Our AI organization system works in the background as you capture notes. It reads your content, assigns relevant labels, identifies thematic connections across your entire collection, and generates summaries of related clusters. When you need to find something, AI-powered search understands what you're looking for, not just keywords.

### AI Design
**Short:** Beautiful layouts that make sense of your thoughts.
**Medium:** How it looks IS how it's organized. ToonNotes uses AI to create visual layouts—timelines, maps, constellations—that transform chaotic notes into organized knowledge. Personalized to your aesthetic, shareable without cleanup.
**Long:** AI Design goes beyond pretty colors. Our system analyzes your note content and objectives to suggest appropriate visual layouts: Knowledge Maps for studying, Idea Constellations for brainstorming, Writing Workspaces for drafting, Trip Planners for travel. Each layout is styled to match your personal aesthetic, with smart theming that maintains consistency across your boards.

### Boards
**Short:** Where real work happens—with AI.
**Medium:** Boards are objective-driven workspaces. Start with a goal ("Plan my Japan trip"), and AI pulls relevant notes, organizes them logically, and presents them beautifully. The output is polished enough to share.
**Long:** While the Notes layer is for zero-friction capture, Boards are where notes become useful. Each Board has an objective—learning a subject, planning a trip, drafting an article. AI automatically pulls relevant notes from your collection, organizes them according to your goal, and applies a visual layout that makes the information digestible. The result is a shareable artifact you're proud of.
