## Short Copy (Social Posts)

### Launch Announcement (General)
```
ToonNotes v2.0 is here.

Four AI agents that understand WHY you take notes:
- Manager: Chaos → Plans
- Muse: Sparks → Ideas
- Librarian: Saved → Used
- Biographer: Past → Present

Your notes finally go somewhere.
```

### MANAGE Mode
```
50 scattered trip notes. No plan. No timeline.

Then ToonNotes asked: "When do you leave?"

One tap later: a day-by-day itinerary with deadlines.

The Manager Agent turns chaos into a plan.
```

### DEVELOP Mode
```
"App for book recommendations by mood, not genre."

That was the whole note. A spark that would have died.

But the Muse Agent asked: "Who would love this?"

Now it's called MoodRead. And it has a plan.
```

### ORGANIZE Mode
```
How many recipes have you saved but never made?

The Librarian Agent tracks what you actually cook.

Made it 3 times? You've got a favorite.
Never touched? Try Next.

Your recipes, finally alive.
```

### EXPERIENCE Mode
```
January 15, 2025: "First day at work. So nervous."

January 15, 2026: The Biographer brings it back.

Maya reads it. Smiles. Writes back:

"You now lead the team. I'm proud of us."

Your past self has messages for you.
```

## Twitter/X Thread

### Launch Thread

```
🧵 ToonNotes v2.0 is here, and it changes everything about how you use your notes.

Here's what we built 👇

---

1/ The insight that started it all:

Notes are only useful if they lead to:
• Action
• Creation
• Retrieval
• Memory

Most notes lead to... nothing. They just sit there.

---

2/ So we built four AI agents.

Each understands a different PURPOSE behind your notes:

M - Manage (scattered → organized)
O - Organize (saved → used)
D - Develop (spark → idea)
E - Experience (past → present)

---

3/ MANAGER AGENT

Have 50 trip notes but no plan?

Manager notices. Asks when you leave. Creates a timeline.

Your chaos becomes an itinerary.

---

4/ MUSE AGENT

Brief idea sitting untouched?

Muse asks: "Want to explore this?"

Three paths: Go deeper. Flip it. Audience.

Your spark becomes a plan.

---

5/ LIBRARIAN AGENT

Saved recipes you never make?

Librarian auto-tags them. Tracks what you cook.

"Made this 5 times!" → It's a favorite.

Your collection becomes alive.

---

6/ BIOGRAPHER AGENT

Journal entries you never reread?

Biographer surfaces them: "One year ago today..."

You read. Reflect. See how far you've come.

Your past becomes present.

---

7/ ToonNotes v2.0 doesn't just store your notes.

It understands them.

And helps you actually USE them.

3. `Your notes finally go somewhere.`
4. `We rebuilt ToonNotes from the ground up.`

### Email Body

```
Subject: ToonNotes v2.0 is here

Hi [Name],

Be honest: how many of your saved notes actually go somewhere?

The trip tips you never organized into a plan.
The ideas that died as one-liners.
The recipes you saved but never cooked.
The journal entries you never looked back at.

Notes are supposed to be useful. But most of them just... sit there.

ToonNotes v2.0 changes that.

We built four AI agents, each designed to understand the PURPOSE behind your notes:

**Manager Agent**
Detects scattered notes. Creates organized plans.
"Your Japan trip is coming together—when do you leave?"

**Muse Agent**
Notices unexplored ideas. Helps them grow.
"This spark has potential. Want to explore it?"

**Librarian Agent**
Auto-tags content. Tracks what you actually use.
"You've made this recipe 5 times! It's a favorite."

**Biographer Agent**
Resurfaces memories. Creates reflection moments.
"One year ago today..."

Your notes finally go somewhere.
