## Copy Guidelines

### Voice & Tone for Pro Launch

| Context | Tone | Example |
|---------|------|---------|
| Announcement | Excited but grounded | "We're thrilled to introduce Pro" |
| Features | Clear and benefit-focused | "Style every note without limits" |
| Pricing | Honest and relatable | "Less than a coffee per month" |
| CTA | Friendly, low pressure | "Try Pro" not "Buy Now" |

### Words to Use

- Unlimited, unlocked, full experience
- Your, personalized, custom
- Simple, easy, cancel anytime
- Community, fans, you asked

### Words to Avoid

- Premium (overused, use "Pro")
- Exclusive (unless truly exclusive)
- Subscribe (use "try" or "start")
- Just $X (feels manipulative)
