# ToonNotes Feature Announcement Email Templates

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-04
**Strategy Version:** v2 (AI Organization + AI Design)
**Use:** New feature launches, major updates

---

## Template Structure

Every feature announcement should follow this structure:

```
1. Subject line (curiosity + benefit)
2. Preview text (expands on subject)
3. Opening hook (pain point or excitement)
4. What's new (clear, concise)
5. Why it matters (benefit to user)
6. How to use it (simple steps)
7. CTA button
8. What's next (optional: roadmap tease)
9. P.S. (secondary CTA or personal note)
```

---

## Voice & Tone (v2)

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Lead with user benefit | Lead with feature name |
| Explain the "why" | Just list specs |
| Keep it scannable | Write walls of text |
| Sound excited but genuine | Sound like marketing |
| Connect to pain points | Assume they care automatically |

---

# EXAMPLE: AI ORGANIZATION FEATURE

## Feature: Smart Search

**Subject lines:**
```
A: Smart Search is here — find any note in seconds
B: "I know I wrote this somewhere" — solved.
C: New: AI-powered search that actually understands you
```

**Preview text:**
```
Search naturally. AI finds what you're looking for.
```

---

**Body:**

```
Hey,

You know that feeling when you KNOW you wrote something down, but you can't find it?

You try different keywords. Scroll through notes. Check multiple apps.

We just made that a thing of the past.

**Smart Search is here.**

It's AI-powered search that understands what you're looking for — not just keywords, but meaning.

---

**Why this matters:**

• **Search naturally** — Type "that sushi place in Tokyo" instead of trying to remember exact words
• **AI understands context** — Finds notes even when your search terms don't match exactly
• **Instant results** — No more scrolling through hundreds of notes hoping to recognize it

---

**How to use it:**

1. Open ToonNotes and tap the search icon
2. Type what you're looking for (natural language works)
3. AI surfaces the right notes — even from months ago

[BUTTON: Try Smart Search]

---

**The best part?**

Combined with auto-labeling, your notes are now truly findable. Capture freely, find anything.

"I know I wrote this somewhere" is officially retired.

[Signature]

P.S. — Already have hundreds of notes? Perfect. Smart Search works on everything you've ever captured. Try finding something old.

# EXAMPLE: AI DESIGN FEATURE

## Feature: Knowledge Maps

**Subject lines:**
```
A: Knowledge Maps are here — turn research into clarity
B: New: AI creates visual study guides from your notes
C: 50 scattered notes → 1 organized Knowledge Map
```

**Preview text:**
```
AI organizes your research into visual, study-ready layouts.
```

---

**Body:**

```
Hey,

Ever have a bunch of research notes but no idea how they fit together?

Articles, quotes, definitions, random thoughts — all captured, none organized.

We just built something for exactly this.

**Introducing Knowledge Maps.**

AI analyzes your notes and creates a visual layout:
- Grouped by theme
- Connections highlighted
- Summaries for each cluster

Your scattered research becomes a study guide. Automatically.

---

**Why this matters:**

• **See the structure** — Finally understand what you've actually been researching
• **Study-ready output** — Not just organized, but visually clear and usable
• **Zero effort** — AI does the grouping and summarizing

---

**How to use it:**

1. Open ToonNotes and tap + to create a new board
2. Select "Knowledge Map"
3. Choose which notes to include (or let AI pick related ones)
4. Watch AI create your visual study guide

[BUTTON: Create a Knowledge Map]

---

**Perfect for:**

📚 Exam prep — Turn semester notes into review material
🔬 Research projects — See how your sources connect
📖 Learning new topics — Organize what you're discovering

Design IS organization. When notes look structured, they make sense.

[Signature]

P.S. — Have notes from a class or project you're working on? Try creating a Knowledge Map from them. The "aha" moment is real.

# EXAMPLE: USE CASE FEATURE

## Feature: Trip Planner Boards

**Subject lines:**
```
A: Trip Planner is here — turn saves into itineraries
B: New: AI creates travel itineraries from your scattered saves
C: 50 Instagram saves → 1 shareable Trip Planner
```

**Preview text:**
```
AI organizes your travel research into day-by-day itineraries.
```

---

**Body:**

```
Hey,

Trip planning usually goes like this:

1. Save 50+ things across Instagram, Google Maps, and random screenshots
2. Promise to organize them later
3. Panic the night before the trip
4. Wing it and miss half the places you saved

Sound familiar?

**Trip Planner boards are here.**

Dump all your saves into ToonNotes. AI creates a day-by-day itinerary organized by neighborhood.

Shareable. Beautiful. Zero effort.

---

**Why this matters:**

• **No more saves graveyard** — Actually use the places you bookmarked
• **Day-by-day organization** — AI groups by location and creates logical flow
• **Share instantly** — Send the Trip Planner to friends, family, travel partners

---

**How to use it:**

1. Capture all your travel saves into ToonNotes (screenshots work too)
2. Create a new board → Select "Trip Planner"
3. AI organizes everything by day and area
4. Share with one tap

[BUTTON: Create a Trip Planner]

---

**Pro tip:**

Start capturing now for your next trip. Even random saves like "cool coffee shop in Barcelona" work. AI figures out the rest.

Your future self will thank you.

[Signature]

P.S. — Already have a trip coming up with scattered research? This is the perfect test. Create a Trip Planner and see what AI does with your chaos.

# EXAMPLE: IMPROVEMENT/UPDATE

## Feature: Faster Auto-Labeling (2x Speed)

**Subject lines:**
```
A: Auto-labeling just got 2x faster
B: Your notes now organize even quicker
C: Speed update: AI labeling is now instant
```

**Preview text:**
```
Capture → labeled in under a second.
```

---

**Body:**

```
Hey,

Small update, big difference:

**Auto-labeling is now 2x faster.**

When you capture a note, AI labels it almost instantly. No waiting.

---

**What changed:**

• Labels appear in under 1 second (was 2-3 seconds)
• Works even when capturing multiple notes quickly
• Same accuracy, just faster

---

**Why it matters:**

The best organization is invisible. You shouldn't notice it happening.

Now you capture → it's labeled → you move on.

Zero friction. Zero waiting.

---

**Nothing to do on your end.**

The update is already live. Just keep capturing.

[BUTTON: Open ToonNotes]

More improvements coming soon.

# EXAMPLE: BETA/EARLY ACCESS

## Feature: Writing Workspace (Beta)

**Subject lines:**
```
A: Early access: Writing Workspace is in beta
B: You're invited: Try Writing Workspace before everyone else
C: Beta testers wanted: New feature for writers
```

**Preview text:**
```
Turn fragments into outlines. We need your feedback.
```

---

**Body:**

```
Hey,

We're building something new for writers, and we want your help testing it.

**Writing Workspace (Beta)**

The problem it solves:
- You have scattered notes about a topic
- Fragments, quotes, bullet points, ideas
- But no structure, no outline, no starting point

Writing Workspace uses AI to organize your fragments into a logical flow.

You get an outline. A starting point. Not a blank page.

---

**What we need from you:**

1. Try creating a Writing Workspace with your notes
2. Tell us what works and what doesn't
3. Help us make it better before full launch

---

**How to access the beta:**

[BUTTON: Join Writing Workspace Beta]

Click the button and you'll get access within 24 hours.

---

**What's in it for you:**

• Early access to the feature
• Direct line to give feedback
• Shape how it works before launch

We're building this for people who capture lots of ideas but struggle to turn them into drafts. If that's you, we need your input.

[Signature]

P.S. — Beta testers who give feedback get Pro free for a month. Just our way of saying thanks.
```
