│  Favorites: 5                            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**The key insight:** Jamie can now see which recipes they ACTUALLY cook vs. just save. The "Try Next" section highlights untried recipes. The Favorites become go-to meals.

## Marketing Copy Variations

### Short (Tweet/Caption)
> Saved recipes that actually get cooked. The Librarian tracks what you use—and celebrates your favorites.

### Medium (Instagram Carousel Last Slide)
> Jamie saved 128 recipes. Made... 5 of them. On rotation.
>
> Sound familiar?
>
> Now the Librarian tracks when Jamie actually cooks something. "I made this!" becomes data.
>
> 3 times? It's a favorite. Never touched? Try Next.
>
> Suddenly, Jamie's recipe collection is alive. Not a graveyard. A menu.
>
> Stop collecting. Start cooking.

### Long (App Store/Landing Page)
> Be honest: how many recipes have you saved that you've never actually made?
>
> We save recipes like we'll live forever. That TikTok pasta. That NYT bread. That thing your friend sent. They pile up. We cook the same 5 meals anyway.
>
> The Librarian Agent changes the game. It auto-tags your recipes, making them findable. But that's just the start.
>
> After you view a recipe, it asks: "Did you make this?" Tap yes, and it starts tracking.
>
> Make it twice? Three times? Five times? You've got a favorite. The Librarian celebrates it.
>
> Never made something? It goes in "Try Next"—recipes waiting for their moment.
>
> Your recipe collection stops being a digital graveyard. It becomes a living menu of things you've tried, things you love, and things you're excited to make next.
>
> That chocolate chip cookie recipe from 6 months ago? You might finally make it.
