# Scenario 2: "The Idea That Grew Up"
## MODE: DEVELOP | Agent: Muse

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-20
**Campaign:** v2-mode-launch

---

## Target Pain Point

> "I have great ideas but they die in my notes app."

---

## User Profile

**Name:** Alex
**Archetype:** Idea Collector / Aspiring Creator
**Behavior:** Captures brilliant ideas in the moment, then forgets about them. Has dozens of one-line "sparks" that never develop into anything.

---

## The Story

### Scene 1: The Spark (Before)

Alex has a moment of inspiration while walking home:

```
Note: "App that helps readers find their next book based on mood, not genre"
```

Saved. Forgotten. Like the 47 other ideas in their notes:
- "Subscription box for houseplants"
- "Podcast matching algorithm"
- "Gratitude app with AI prompts"
- "Neighborhood tool sharing network"
- ... all sitting dormant ...

**Visual:** A note card labeled with "Spark" indicator (small lightbulb icon), timestamp showing it was created 3 days ago, no edits since.

---

### Scene 2: The Nudge (AI Intervention)

3 days after capture, Muse Agent detects:
- Brief, unexpanded idea
- No follow-up activity
- Pattern: idea capture without development

**The Nudge Card Appears:**

### Scene 3: The Development

Alex taps "Audience" - curious who would actually use this.

**Muse presents a writing prompt:**

```

│                                          │
│  • Who struggles with this problem?      │

│  └─────────────────────────────────────┘ │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Alex writes:**

> "People who finish a book and stare at their shelf not knowing what to read next. They're not looking for 'mystery' or 'romance' - they want the FEELING they got from the last book. Like, I want something that makes me feel hopeful like 'A Man Called Ove' did. My girlfriend does this too - she just wants to feel cozy. Bookstores organize by genre but people read for EMOTION."

### Scene 4: Idea Evolution

**Muse responds with synthesis:**

Alex continues exploring through several sessions...

### Scene 5: The Transformation (After)

**Idea Maturity Progress:**

```
💭 Spark  →  🌱 Explored  →  🌳 Developed  →  🚀 Ready
    ●            ●               ●             ○
```

**The note has grown into a full concept:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  📱 MoodRead - Book Discovery App        │
│  Status: 🌳 Developed                    │

│                                          │
│  💎 Core Insight                         │
│  People read for emotion, not genre.     │
│  Discovery should match how readers      │
│  actually choose books.                  │
│                                          │
│  🎯 Target User                          │
│  Avid readers (2+ books/month) who       │
│  struggle with "what to read next"       │
│                                          │
│  ⚡ How It Works                          │
│  1. Rate books by how they made you feel │
│  2. Algorithm builds your mood profile   │
│  3. Suggestions based on desired feeling │
│                                          │
│  🚫 Key Risks                            │
│  - Mood is subjective                    │
│  - Cold start problem                    │
│  - Book data availability                │
│                                          │
│  📋 Next Steps                           │
│  □ Interview 5 readers about discovery   │
│  □ Research Goodreads API               │
│  □ Sketch 3 app screens                  │

**Bridges to MANAGE mode** - The idea becomes a project with tasks.

## Marketing Copy Variations

### Short (Tweet/Caption)
> A one-line idea became a business plan. The Muse Agent never lets sparks die.

### Medium (Instagram Carousel Last Slide)
> "App for book recommendations by mood, not genre."
>
> That's it. That was Alex's note. A spark that would have died like all the others.
>
> But the Muse Agent asked: "Who would love this and why?"
>
> Alex wrote. Then wrote more. Then explored risks. Then mechanics.
>
> Now it's called MoodRead. And it has a plan.
>
> Your ideas want to grow. The Muse helps them.

### Long (App Store/Landing Page)
> How many brilliant ideas have you captured and then... forgotten?
>
> We all do it. A flash of inspiration. A quick note. And then life moves on. The idea sits there. Undeveloped. Unexamined. Eventually buried under newer notes.
>
> The Muse Agent is different. It notices when you've captured something with potential. A few days later, it gently asks: "Want to explore this?"
>
> Not with pressure. With curiosity. Three paths to expansion:
>
> **"Go deeper"** - Why does this matter to you?
> **"Flip it"** - What if the opposite were true?
> **"Audience"** - Who would love this and why?
>
> Pick one. Write freely. The Muse synthesizes what you discover and offers the next expansion path.
>
> Over time, your spark becomes explored. Then developed. Then ready for action.
>
> A one-line idea can become a business plan. It just needs a little help growing up.

## Social Media Adaptations

### Instagram Carousel (4 slides)

| Slide | Content |
|-------|---------|
| 1 | Large quote: "I have great ideas but they die in my notes app." + graveyard of faded note cards |
| 2 | Alex captures the book app idea - small spark icon appears |
| 3 | Muse nudge: "This spark has potential! Want to explore it?" + three expansion options |
| 4 | Fully developed MoodRead concept note + maturity progress bar + tagline: "A one-line idea became a business plan." |

### TikTok Script (15-30s)
```
[Hook - 3s]
"My notes app is where ideas go to die..."
*scroll through faded one-line notes*

[Build - 5s]
"But then I wrote this..."
*type: "Book recommendations by mood, not genre"*

[Turn - 12s]
"And ToonNotes asked me to explore it."
*show Muse nudge*
"Who would love this?"
*Alex types about readers*
"Then HOW would it work?"
*show mechanics section filling in*
"Then what could KILL it?"
*show risks*

[Payoff - 7s]
*show full developed concept*
"Now it's MoodRead. And it has a plan."
*maturity bar fills: Spark → Explored → Developed*

[CTA - 3s]
"Your ideas want to grow too."
```

## Key Metrics to Track

- Spark → Explored conversion rate
- Explored → Developed conversion rate
- Average expansion sessions per idea
- Ideas that bridge to MANAGE mode (become projects)

---

## Expansion Prompts Library

### "Go Deeper" Prompts
- "Why does this matter to you personally?"
- "When did you first notice this problem?"
- "What would the world look like if this existed?"

### "Flip It" Prompts
- "What if the opposite approach worked better?"
- "What would happen if you made it 10x simpler?"
- "Who would hate this idea and why?"

### "Audience" Prompts
- "Who feels this pain most acutely?"
- "When do they experience this frustration?"
- "What do they currently do instead?"

### "Mechanics" Prompts
- "What's the simplest version that could work?"
- "What's the first thing a user would do?"
- "What data would you need?"

### "Risks" Prompts
- "What could make this completely fail?"
- "Why hasn't someone built this already?"
- "What's the hardest part to get right?"
