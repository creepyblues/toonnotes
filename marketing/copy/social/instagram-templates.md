I tried EVERYTHING:

• Apple Notes (can't find anything)
• Evernote (gave up years ago)

Then I realized: I don't need to organize. I need something that organizes FOR me.

## Post 1: Quote/Statement

**Pillar:** Pain Point Relief

**Visual:** Bold text on brand gradient background

**Text on image:**
"The best organization system is one you don't have to maintain."

**Caption:**
```
Hot take: You don't need a better system. You need no system at all.

Folders fail because you have to maintain them.
Tags fail because you have to remember them.
"Organize later" fails because you never do.

The best notes system is one that runs itself.

That's why ToonNotes uses AI to organize automatically. Capture everything. Find anything. Zero maintenance.
