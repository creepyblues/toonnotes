## TikTok Content Strategy

TikTok requires a different approach than Instagram/Twitter:
- **Hook in first 1-3 seconds** (or they scroll)
- **Authentic > polished** (relatable wins)
- **Trend participation** (sounds, formats, challenges)
- **Satisfying content** (ASMR-style organization)
- **POV format** (first-person relatable moments)
- **Fast-paced** (15-60 seconds ideal)

---

## Content Pillar Mix

| Pillar | Mix | TikTok Angle |
|--------|-----|--------------|
| AI Organization | 30% | Satisfying auto-label demos, "watch AI organize" |
| Pain Point Relief | 25% | POV struggles, relatable moments, "finally" reactions |
| Use Case Demos | 20% | Before/after transformations, real results |
| AI Design | 15% | Beautiful output reveals, aesthetic content |
| Trends & Humor | 10% | Trend participation with organization spin |

---

## Posting Schedule

| Frequency | Best Times (EST) |
|-----------|------------------|
| 5-7/week | 7-11 PM |
| Peak days | Tue-Thu |
