## Reddit Strategy Overview

Reddit is fundamentally different from other social platforms:

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Contribute genuinely to communities | Self-promote aggressively |
| Answer questions helpfully | Make every post about ToonNotes |
| Share honestly as a creator | Use marketing speak |
| Follow subreddit rules strictly | Spam multiple subreddits |
| Build reputation over time | Expect instant results |
| Be a community member first | Be a marketer first |

**Core principle:** Be a helpful community member who happens to have built something useful. NOT a marketer trying to extract value from communities.

## Template 1: "I Made This" Soft Launch

**Best for:** r/productivity, r/NoteTaking, r/PKMS, r/SideProject

**Title:**
```
I built an app that uses AI to organize notes automatically (no folders, no tags)
```

**Body:**
```
Hey everyone,

I've been a note hoarder for years. I'd capture everything—ideas, quotes, bookmarks, random thoughts—but never organize any of it. I tried Notion (too complex), Obsidian (too much setup), Apple Notes (can't find anything).

So I built something different.

**The problem I was solving:**
I don't want to organize. I want to FIND things when I need them. The value isn't in perfect folders—it's in retrieval.

**What it does:**
- AI auto-labels every note (you just capture, it categorizes)
- Smart grouping connects related notes automatically
- Visual layouts turn chaos into organized boards (Knowledge Maps, Trip Planners, etc.)

**The core idea:**
Capture everything. Organize nothing. Find anything.

**What I learned building it:**
[Share 2-3 genuine insights about the problem space]

Would love feedback from this community. What's your biggest pain point with note organization?

[Link in comments if anyone wants to try it]

## Template 2: Genuine Problem Discussion

**Best for:** r/productivity, r/NoteTaking, r/PKMS

**Title:**
```
Why do we keep creating folder systems we never maintain?
```

**Body:**
```
Genuine question for this community.

I've noticed a pattern in myself and others:

1. Feel guilty about messy notes
2. Create elaborate folder structure
3. Use it for maybe 2 weeks
4. Slowly stop maintaining it
5. Back to chaos
6. Repeat

Why do we do this? Some theories:

**The friction problem:** Deciding where something goes is mental overhead. When capturing quickly, we skip it. Then "organize later" becomes never.

**The retrieval problem:** We think folders = findability. But search is actually better for finding things. We just don't trust it.

**The visual problem:** Messy notes FEEL chaotic, even if we can find things. We want them to LOOK organized too.

I've started using AI to auto-organize and honestly it's changed my relationship with notes. But I'm curious—what's worked for you? Anyone actually maintain a folder system long-term?
```

## Template 3: Use Case Story (Trip Planning)

**Best for:** r/travel, r/solotravel, r/TravelHacks

**Title:**
```
How I organized 50+ trip saves into an actual itinerary (without going insane)
```

**Body:**
```
Just got back from Japan and wanted to share what finally worked for trip planning.

**The problem:**
- 30+ Instagram saves
- 20+ Google Maps pins
- Random screenshots
- Blog bookmarks everywhere
- Notes from friends' recommendations

All scattered. No structure. Classic trip planning chaos.

**What I tried before:**
- Google Docs (became a mess)
- Notion template (took forever to set up)
- Just winging it (missed half the good stuff)

**What actually worked:**

I used a note app with AI organization (ToonNotes, but the concept applies).

The approach:
1. Dump EVERYTHING into one place (all the saves, screenshots, notes)
2. Let AI auto-categorize (it tagged restaurants, activities, areas, etc.)
3. AI created a "Trip Planner" board organized by neighborhood/day
4. Shared with my travel partner instantly

Total time organizing: Maybe 10 minutes? AI did the heavy lifting.

**The result:**
- Actually went to the places I saved
- Had a shareable itinerary for the group
- Didn't miss the random ramen spot someone recommended

Anyone else struggle with the "saves graveyard" problem? What's worked for you?
```

## Template 4: Study Tips (Knowledge Map)

**Best for:** r/GetStudying, r/GradSchool, r/college

**Title:**
```
Turned my scattered research notes into something I could actually study from
```

**Body:**
```
Sharing this because I wish someone told me sooner.

**The situation:**
- 50+ notes about my thesis topic
- Articles, quotes, definitions, random thoughts
- Spread across 3 months of research
- Zero organization
- Panic setting in

**The old approach (didn't work):**
- Tried to read through everything sequentially
- Attempted to create outline manually
- Got overwhelmed, gave up, repeated

**What actually worked:**

Used AI to create a "Knowledge Map" of all my notes:
- AI grouped notes by theme automatically
- Generated summaries for each cluster
- Visual layout showed connections between concepts
- Could finally see the structure of my research

It's like the AI read all my notes and said "here's what you're actually researching."

**The tool:**
I used ToonNotes (has AI organization built in), but the concept is:
1. Dump all notes in one place
2. Let AI find patterns and group them
3. Visual output you can study from

Went from "I have no idea what I'm doing" to "okay, here are my 5 main themes."

Anyone else deal with research note chaos? Would love to hear other approaches.

## Template 5: Honest Review/Comparison

**Best for:** r/productivity, r/NoteTaking, r/PKMS (when comparison posts are allowed)

**Title:**
```
Honest take: AI note organization vs traditional PKM systems
```

**Body:**
```
I've used a lot of note systems over the years. Here's my honest comparison of AI-powered organization vs traditional approaches.

**Traditional (Notion, Obsidian, Roam):**

Pros:
- Full control over structure
- Can build exactly what you want
- Powerful once set up
- Large communities & resources

Cons:
- Significant setup time
- Ongoing maintenance required
- Easy to over-engineer
- "Building the system" becomes procrastination

**AI-Powered (ToonNotes, newer AI tools):**

Pros:
- Zero setup
- No maintenance
- Auto-categorization actually works
- Visual outputs without effort

Cons:
- Less control over taxonomy
- Trusting AI to "get it right"
- Newer, less mature ecosystems
- May not satisfy power users

**My honest take:**

For people who enjoy building systems: Stick with Notion/Obsidian. The control is worth it if you'll actually maintain it.

For people who've tried and failed at traditional PKM: AI organization might be the answer. I'm in this camp.

The question isn't "which is better" but "which fits how you actually work?"

Full disclosure: I now use ToonNotes (AI-based) after years of Notion/Obsidian attempts. But I know people who thrive with traditional systems. There's no universal answer.

What's worked for you?

# COMMENT TEMPLATES

## Responding to "Looking for Note App" Posts

### When someone asks for recommendations:

```
Depends what you're looking for!

If you want powerful + customizable: Notion or Obsidian are great but require setup time.

If you want simple + automatic: I've been using ToonNotes—AI organizes everything automatically, no folders/tags needed. Good for people (like me) who never maintain systems.

If you want truly minimal: Apple Notes or Google Keep, though finding things later is rough.

What's your main use case? That might help narrow it down.
```

### When someone complains about organization:

```
I feel this deeply. I have hundreds of notes I've never looked at again.

What helped me: stopped trying to organize manually. Now I use an AI tool that auto-labels everything. I just capture, and it categorizes.

Sounds lazy but honestly? It works better than any system I tried to maintain.

The "organize later" lie finally stopped because there's no "organize" step.
```

### When someone shares a complex system:

```
This is impressive! Genuine question though—how long did the setup take, and how much time do you spend maintaining it?

I've tried building systems like this but always fell off after a few weeks. Curious if there's a secret to making it stick long-term.
```

### When someone asks about AI tools:

```
I've been using ToonNotes for a few months. The AI auto-labeling actually works surprisingly well—it reads the note content and assigns relevant tags automatically.

The visual board feature is what sold me. AI creates Knowledge Maps, Trip Planners, etc. from your notes. Turns chaos into something usable.

Not perfect for everyone—power users might want more control. But for "I just want my notes to organize themselves" it's been solid.

Happy to answer specific questions if you're curious.
```

## Responding to Pain Point Posts

### "I have too many notes and can't find anything":

```
This is literally why I switched approaches.

The problem isn't organization—it's retrieval. We think folders = findability, but search is actually better.

What worked for me: stopped organizing entirely, just capture everything, rely on search + AI auto-labeling to find things later.

Counterintuitive but I actually find things faster now than when I had an "organized" system.
```

### "I've tried every app and nothing sticks":

```
Same. Notion (too complex), Obsidian (too much setup), Apple Notes (can't find anything), Evernote (gave up years ago).

What finally worked: accepting that I'm not going to organize manually. Ever. It's just not who I am.

Found an app where AI does the organization automatically. No system to build, no maintenance, just capture and find.

Might not work for everyone but for us "tried everything" people, it's worth a shot.
```

### "Should I use Notion or Obsidian?":

```
Honest answer: neither might be right if you're asking this question.

Both require significant investment to set up and maintain. They're powerful but demanding.

Questions to ask yourself:
- Do you enjoy building systems? → Obsidian
- Do you need databases/complex views? → Notion
- Do you just want notes that work? → Something simpler

I tried both, spent hours on setup, eventually abandoned both. Now I use something with AI organization—no setup, no maintenance. But that's just me.

What's your actual use case?
```

## Responding in Fandom Subreddits

### r/webtoons, r/anime (only when genuinely relevant):

```
Random but I've started keeping notes on series I'm reading/watching—favorite panels, plot points I want to remember, theories.

Was a mess until I found an app that auto-organizes everything. Now I have like a personal wiki for each series.

Anyone else keep notes on their favorites or am I just obsessive? 😅
