For people who take lots of notes but hate organizing them.

You know that note you saved weeks ago? The one you know exists but can't find? ToonNotes uses AI to automatically label and organize your notes—so you never have to.


AI AUTO-LABELING

Write naturally. AI reads your content and suggests the right labels—automatically. No manual tagging. No folder decisions. Just smart organization that happens in the background.

- High-confidence labels apply automatically
- Medium-confidence suggestions for your approval
- 30 built-in label presets (Productivity, Planning, Creative, and more)
- Your notes, organized without the work


CUSTOM DESIGNS FROM ANY IMAGE

Upload any image and AI creates a custom note theme:

- Extracts colors and typography style
- Generates a character sticker with background removed
- Apply to any note instantly

Your notes become uniquely yours—without design skills required.


BOARDS

Notes with the same label automatically group into visual boards. See all your #ideas, #todo, or #reading in one beautiful collection. Each board has its own style.
