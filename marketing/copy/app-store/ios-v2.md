## Description (4000 chars)

```
ToonNotes now understands WHY you're taking notes.

Four AI personalities. One goal: Help you actually use what you capture.

MEET YOUR AI TEAM

Every note has a purpose. ToonNotes v2.0 learns yours.

Manager Agent (M)
Turn scattered notes into actionable plans. Have 50 trip notes but no itinerary? The Manager notices, asks when you leave, and creates a day-by-day timeline from your existing notes.

Muse Agent (D)
Grow ideas from sparks to reality. That one-line app idea you saved? The Muse helps you explore it—asking "Who would love this?" and "What could kill it?"—until it becomes a real plan.

Librarian Agent (O)
Find and track what you save. Auto-tag recipes, track which ones you actually cook, celebrate your favorites. Your recipe collection stops being a graveyard.

Biographer Agent (E)
Resurface memories at the right moment. "One year ago today..." Your journal entries come back when you need them, with space to reflect on how far you've come.

HOW IT WORKS

2. AI detects the purpose behind your notes
3. The right agent offers helpful nudges

## Localization Notes

When translating, preserve:
- The four agent names (Manager, Muse, Librarian, Biographer)
- MODE as an acronym/branding
- Emoji usage for visual consistency
- Scenario examples (trip, idea, recipe, memory)

Adapt for cultural context:
- "Japan trip" example may need localization
- Recipe examples may vary by region
- Job/career scenarios may need cultural adaptation
