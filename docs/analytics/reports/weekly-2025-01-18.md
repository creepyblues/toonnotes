## Concerns

1. **GA4 Console Configuration Pending**

   - Custom dimensions, funnels, and audiences need to be configured in GA4 console
   - Follow `apps/expo/docs/GA4-CONFIGURATION-GUIDE.md`

2. **BigQuery Export Not Yet Enabled**
   - Impact: Low
   - Advanced cohort analysis requires BigQuery export
   - Consider enabling for deeper retention analysis

3. **No Historical Data for Comparison**
   - Impact: Low
   - This is the baseline week; trends will be visible starting next week

---

## Recommendations

1. **Complete GA4 Console Configuration**
   - Priority: High
   - Expected impact: Enables funnel analysis, audience targeting
   - Action: Follow steps in GA4-CONFIGURATION-GUIDE.md (est. 30 min)

2. **Enable BigQuery Export**
   - Priority: Medium
   - Expected impact: Unlocks advanced SQL analysis for cohorts, LTV
   - Action: GA4 > Admin > BigQuery links > Link

3. **Set Up Custom Alerts**
   - Priority: Medium
   - Expected impact: Proactive anomaly detection
   - Action: Configure crash spike, purchase drop, generation failure alerts
