# Marketing Campaign Orchestrator

This skill orchestrates multi-channel marketing campaigns using **Strategy v2: AI Organization + AI Design** positioning. All campaigns target the "Prolific Procrastinator" ICP and use pain-relief messaging.

## Strategy v2 Core Positioning

**One-liner:** "Capture everything. Organize nothing. See it beautifully."

**ICP:** The Prolific Procrastinator - heavy note-takers who have given up on organization

**Two Pillars:**
1. **AI Organization** - Structure without effort
2. **AI Design** - Visualization as organization

**Use Cases:** Studying, Collecting Ideas, Drafting Writing, Trip Planning

## When to Use This Skill

- Planning a feature launch campaign
- Creating seasonal promotional campaigns
- Coordinating multi-channel content
- Tracking campaign status and performance
- Generating campaign reports
- Archiving completed campaigns

## Commands

```
/marketing-campaign create --type=feature-launch --feature="Pro Subscription"
/marketing-campaign create --type=seasonal --theme="back-to-school"
/marketing-campaign create --type=partnership --partner="Webtoon Name"
/marketing-campaign create --type=use-case --case=studying      # Use-case focused (v2)
/marketing-campaign create --type=use-case --case=trip-planning # Use-case focused (v2)
/marketing-campaign create --type=pillar --pillar=ai-organization  # Pillar focused (v2)
/marketing-campaign list                          # List all campaigns
/marketing-campaign list --status=active          # Filter by status
/marketing-campaign status --campaign=pro-launch  # Check specific campaign
/marketing-campaign update --campaign=pro-launch --status=active
/marketing-campaign archive --campaign=pro-launch
/marketing-campaign report --campaign=pro-launch
/marketing-campaign --dry-run                     # Preview without creating
/marketing-campaign create --from-brief="path/to/brief.md"  # Create from feature brief
```

### From Feature Brief

When using `--from-brief`, the campaign is pre-populated with messaging, hooks, and asset requirements from a feature brief generated by `/feature-launcher`.

```
/marketing-campaign create --from-brief="marketing/product/briefs/generated/2026-01-10-real-time-sync.md"
```

This:
1. Creates campaign.yaml with brief's messaging pre-filled
2. Sets campaign type based on feature category
3. Pre-populates channel actions based on brief's social hooks
4. Adds asset checklist from brief's requirements
5. Triggers the standard campaign pipeline:
   - `/marketing-copy --from-brief=...`
   - `/social-scheduler --from-brief=...`
   - `/marketing-assets specs --campaign=...`

## Campaign Types

### Feature Launch

For new feature releases. Coordinates App Store updates, social announcements, and landing page updates.

**Typical Duration:** 4-6 weeks
**Channels:** App Store, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, Landing Page

### Seasonal

For holiday, back-to-school, or trending moments. Focus on themed content and limited-time messaging.

**Typical Duration:** 2-4 weeks
**Channels:** Instagram, TikTok, Twitter

### Partnership

For collaborations with IP owners, influencers, or other brands.

**Typical Duration:** Varies
**Channels:** All relevant platforms

### Use Case (v2)

For campaigns focused on specific use cases from Strategy v2.

**Available Cases:**
- `studying` - Knowledge Map for students/researchers
- `ideas` - Idea Constellation for creative thinkers
- `writing` - Writing Workspace for content creators
- `trip-planning` - Trip Planner for travelers

**Typical Duration:** 2-4 weeks
**Channels:** Targeted by use case audience
**Messaging:** Pain → Solution → Board Output format

### Pillar (v2)

For campaigns focused on one of the two AI pillars.

**Available Pillars:**
- `ai-organization` - "Structure without effort" focus
- `ai-design` - "Visualization as organization" focus

**Typical Duration:** 2-4 weeks
**Channels:** All platforms
**Messaging:** Pillar-specific pain points and benefits

## Campaign Workflow

### Step 1: Create Campaign

When `/marketing-campaign create` is invoked:

```
1. Read marketing/messaging.md for core messaging
2. Read relevant audience definitions
3. If feature-launch: Read PRD for feature details
4. Generate campaign.yaml configuration
5. Save to marketing/campaigns/active/{campaign-slug}/
```

### Step 2: Generate Assets

The campaign automatically triggers asset generation:

```
Campaign Creation
       │
       ├─→ /marketing-copy --feature="{Feature}"
       │      └─→ Generates copy for all channels
       │
       ├─→ /aso-optimizer generate (if app-store channel)
       │      └─→ Updates App Store copy
       │
       ├─→ /social-scheduler generate --feature="{Feature}"
       │      └─→ Creates content calendar
       │
       └─→ Asset specs documented in campaign.yaml
```

### Step 3: Review & Launch

Campaign enters "planning" status until manually set to "active".

### Step 4: Monitor & Report

Use `/marketing-campaign report` to generate performance summary.

### Step 5: Archive

Completed campaigns move to `marketing/campaigns/archive/`.

## Campaign YAML Structure (v2)
