# Development Diary Skill

Automates the creation and management of development diary entries for ToonNotes, capturing work sessions from Claude Code history and git commits.

## When to Use This Skill

- At the end of a development session to generate a diary entry
- During sessions to capture important insights or decisions
- To take screenshots of completed features for the diary
- To review and publish draft entries
- To check diary status and recent entries

## Commands

### Generate Entry

Generate a diary entry for today or a specific date.

```
/diary generate                    # Generate today's entry
/diary generate --date=2026-01-08  # Generate for specific date
/diary generate --screenshot       # Include screenshot capture
```

### Add Insight

Capture an insight or decision during a session.

```
/diary add "insight text"
/diary add --category=decision "Chose confidence threshold of 0.7"
/diary add --category=learning "Background removal fails on low-contrast images"
```

Categories: `decision`, `learning`, `insight`, `todo`

### Capture Screenshot

Take a screenshot of current app state.

```
/diary screenshot                           # Auto-named
/diary screenshot --name="quality-preview"  # Custom name
/diary screenshot --url=http://localhost:3000/some-page
```

### Manage Entries

```
/diary list                    # List recent entries
/diary list --drafts           # List only drafts
/diary publish 2026-01-09      # Publish a draft
/diary status                  # Show today's progress
```

## Generation Workflow

When `/diary generate` is invoked:

### Date Determination

First, determine the target date for the entry:

1. **If user specified `--date=YYYY-MM-DD`:** Use that date (e.g., `/diary generate --date=2026-01-08` → use `2026-01-08`)
2. **If no date specified:** Use today's date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format

Store this as the `TARGET_DATE` to use in all subsequent steps.

### Step 1: Collect Claude Code History

Run `scripts/collect_history.py` to parse `~/.claude/history.jsonl`:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/diary/scripts/collect_history.py --date={TARGET_DATE}
```

This extracts:
- User prompts from sessions for the ToonNotes project
- Timestamps and session IDs
- Groupings by session

### Step 2: Analyze Git Commits

Run `scripts/analyze_commits.py` to get git activity:

```bash
python3 .claude/skills/diary/scripts/analyze_commits.py --date={TARGET_DATE}
```

This extracts:
- Commit messages and timestamps
- Files changed (names only, no code)
- Lines added/deleted statistics
- Auto-categorization based on commit messages

### Step 3: Correlate and Categorize

Match prompts with commits by timestamp proximity. Categorize all activities using these keywords:

| Category | Keywords |
|----------|----------|
| Research | research, investigate, explore, analyze, study, compare |
| Planning | plan, design, architect, structure, decide, spec |
| Implementation | implement, create, add, build, develop, feature |
| Bug Fix | fix, bug, issue, error, crash, resolve, debug |
| Refactoring | refactor, cleanup, reorganize, simplify, improve |
| Documentation | doc, document, readme, update docs |
| Testing | test, e2e, playwright, unit test, coverage |

### Step 4: Load Manual Insights

Check for insights added during the day via `/diary add`:

```
marketing/development_diary/drafts/.insights-{TARGET_DATE}.json
```

### Step 5: Capture Screenshots (if --screenshot)

Use Playwright MCP to capture current app state:

```
mcp__plugin_playwright_playwright__browser_navigate
mcp__plugin_playwright_playwright__browser_take_screenshot
```

Save to: `marketing/development_diary/screenshots/{TARGET_DATE}/`

### Step 6: Generate Entry

Use the template at `marketing/development_diary/templates/daily-entry.md` to generate a complete entry with:

- YAML frontmatter (date, status, categories, etc.)
- Daily summary (2-3 sentences)
- Work sessions with timestamps
- Categorized activity lists
- Screenshots with captions
- Statistics table
- Tomorrow's focus section

### Step 7: Save Draft

Write to: `marketing/development_diary/drafts/{TARGET_DATE}.md`

## Privacy Guidelines

**DO NOT include in entries:**
- Actual code snippets
- API keys, secrets, or credentials
- Internal business logic details
- User data or PII

**DO include:**
- Feature names and descriptions
- File counts and change statistics
- High-level architectural decisions
- Public-facing UI screenshots

## Output Locations

| Type | Path |
|------|------|
| Drafts | `marketing/development_diary/drafts/YYYY-MM-DD.md` |
| Published | `marketing/development_diary/published/YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD.md` |
| Screenshots | `marketing/development_diary/screenshots/YYYY-MM-DD/` |
| Insights | `marketing/development_diary/drafts/.insights-YYYY-MM-DD.json` |

# Development Diary - January 9, 2026

## Daily Summary

Focused on implementing quality assessment for AI-generated designs. Added server-side validation to catch hallucinations before returning results to users. Also fixed a background removal edge case and updated documentation.

---

## Work Sessions

### Session 1: Morning Research (8:00 AM - 10:30 AM)

**Focus:** Quality Assessment Research

Activities:
- Researched Gemini image generation hallucination patterns
- Analyzed existing design results for failure modes

**Key Prompts:**
- "Research Gemini hallucination patterns for image generation"
- "What quality checks can we add to detect bad generations?"

---

### Session 2: Implementation (11:00 AM - 3:00 PM)

**Focus:** Quality Service Implementation

Activities:
- Created quality service for assessing generated designs
- Added database migration for quality tracking
- Integrated quality checks into design generation flow

**Files Changed:** 5 files (+342/-28 lines)

---

## Categorized Work

### Implementation
- Quality service for design assessment
- Database migration for quality tracking

### Bug Fix
- Fixed background removal edge case for transparent images

### Documentation
- Updated CLAUDE.md with quality service documentation

## Screenshots

*Quality assessment UI showing confidence scores*

---

## Insights & Learnings

> **Decision:** Chose to implement retry logic on client side rather than server to reduce Gemini API costs.

> **Learning:** Background removal API fails silently on very low contrast images.
